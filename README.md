# Sudoku

In this sudoku application thera are three levels namely beginner,intermediate and advanced. There is a base sudoku. Program changes it automatically with the help of random 
numbers if you execute it and if you want to change it again you can generate a new sudoku-puzzle. If you fill all the spaces the program will ask you if you want to continue
or check your solution. No worries! the program makes all of those. I am just trying to explain it a litte bit :)
